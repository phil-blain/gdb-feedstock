	Due to macOS security restrictions, the GDB executable 
	needs to be codesigned to be able to control other processes.

	The codesigning process requires the Command Line Tools
	(or a full XCode installation). To install the Command Line
	Tools, run
	
	  xcode-select --install
	
	The codesigning process also requires administrative permissions
	(your user must be able to run \`sudo\`).

	To codesign GDB, simply run the included script:

	  macos-codesign-gdb.sh

	and enter your password. 

	Make sure this environment, "$(basename $PREFIX)", is activated
	so that "macos-codesign-gdb.sh" is found in your \$PATH.
